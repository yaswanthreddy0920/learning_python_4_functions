Project Overview
This repository contains my initial learning notes and code snippets for Python 3. As a BBA student specializing in BI and Data Analytics, I am focusing on mastering Python to automate data workflows and perform complex business analyses.

🛠 Concepts Covered
This module focuses on the foundational syntax required to handle data before moving into advanced libraries like Pandas.

1. Data Types & Variables
Integers & Floats: Handling numerical data for calculations.

Strings: Managing text data.

Complex Numbers: Using the complex() constructor.

Booleans: Logical True/False for conditional business logic.

2. Basic Arithmetic & Operators
I explored the standard mathematical operations, including:

Floor Division (//): Useful for rounding down results.

Modulus (%): Finding remainders.

Exponentiation (**): Power calculations.

BODMAS: Understanding the order of operations in Python.

3. String Manipulation (The "Analyst" Essentials)
Data is often "dirty." Mastering string functions is the first step toward Data Cleaning.

Slicing & Indexing: Accessing specific parts of a string (e.g., b[0:3]).

Cleaning Functions: * .rstrip() to remove unwanted trailing symbols (like "!!!").

.split() to turn a single string into a list (useful for CSV processing).

.replace() for data standardization.

Boolean Checks: Using .isalnum() and .islower() to validate data input.

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repo:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/[Your-Username]/learning_python_1_datastructures.git
Run the script:

Bash

python learning_python_1.py
📈 Next Steps
[ ] Master Lists and Tuples (indexing, nesting).

[ ] Learn Dictionary manipulation (essential for JSON data).

[ ] Move into Conditional Statements (if/else) to build basic logic.
